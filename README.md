# URL Analyzer

### A simple tool to analyze and categorize URLs as secure, non-secure, or invalid.

## Overview

## Features

- **Secure URL Detection**: Identifies URLs that start with `https://` as secure.
- **Non-Secure URL Detection**: Identifies URLs that start with `http://` as non-secure.
- **Invalid URL Detection**: Flags URLs that do not start with `http://` or `https://` as invalid.
